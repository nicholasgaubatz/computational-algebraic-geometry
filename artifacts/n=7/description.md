# artifacts/n=7

This directory contains some results for graphs on 7 vertices. Checking WLP for all 853
isomorphism classes took about an hour and a half, so to avoid redoing this we store
results here.

## Files:

- `allAOTAlgebrasAsStrings.m2`: loadable QuotientRings for all graphs of the given
  number of vertices.
- `allGraphicArrangements.m2`: e.g., $\{\{ a-b, a-c, b-c \}, \{a-b, a-c\} \}$.
- `allHilbSeries.m2`: The Hilbert series for the above AOT algebras.
- `allHilbSeriesL.m2`: The Hilbert series for the above AOT algebras modded by the
  ideal generated by the sum of the algebras' variables (possibly different for
  different AOT algebras).
